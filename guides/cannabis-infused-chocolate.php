        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup (120 ml)</strong> Cannabis-Infused Coconut Oil or food-grade Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup (50g)</strong> Unsweetened Cocoa Powder (Dutch-processed works well).</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup (50g)</strong> Powdered Sugar (can substitute with honey or agave, but may affect texture).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: Using infused cocoa butter is pricier but makes the chocolate more stable and solid at room temperature.</em></p>

        <h3>Equipment:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Medium-sized bowl.</li>
            <li>Sifter or fine-mesh strainer.</li>
            <li>Whisk.</li>
            <li>Silicone molds (chocolate bar molds are best IMO).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Melt the Fat:</strong> If your infused coconut oil or cocoa butter is solid, gently melt it in a microwave-safe bowl or on the stovetop until it is fully liquid.</li>
            <li><strong>Sift and Combine:</strong> In your medium bowl, sift half of the powdered sugar and cocoa powder into the melted infused oil. Whisk until smooth to prevent lumps.</li>
            <li><strong>Whisk in the Rest:</strong> Sift in the remaining half of the sugar and cocoa powder and whisk again until the mixture is completely smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li><strong>Mold Your Masterpiece:</strong> Carefully pour or spoon the chocolate mixture into your silicone molds.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill Out:</strong> Place the filled molds into the fridge or freezer for 20-30 minutes, or until the chocolate is completely firm.</li>
            <li><strong>Unmold and Enjoy:</strong> Once fully set, carefully remove the chocolates from their molds. Savor the fruits of your labor!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips, Tricks, and Potency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Potency:</strong> The strength of your chocolate depends entirely on the strength of your infused oil. Always know your dosage and clearly label your final product. Start with a very small piece!</li>
            <li><strong>Flavor Burst:</strong> Add a drop or two of mint, orange, or vanilla extract for a refreshing twist.</li>
            <li><strong>Crunchy Delight:</strong> Gently mix in chopped nuts, crispy rice cereal, or toffee bits for added texture and flavor just before molding.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Smarts:</strong> Store your homemade chocolate in an airtight container in the fridge for several weeks or in the freezer for up to a year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This recipe is incredibly versatile, so don't be afraid to get creative! The possibilities are endless.</p>
