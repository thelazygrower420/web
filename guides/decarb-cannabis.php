        <h2>What is Decarboxylation?</h2>
        <p>Cannabis in its raw form contains <strong>THCA</strong> (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid), a non-intoxicating compound. When you heat cannabis, THCA converts to <strong>THC</strong> (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive compound that gets you high. This process of using heat to activate cannabis is called decarboxylation.</p>

        <h2>Why Decarboxylate?</h2>
        <p>If you're using cannabis for edibles or other infusions, decarboxylation is essential. Without it, you won't experience the full effects of the THC, and your edibles might be underwhelming.</p>

        <h2>Methods for Decarboxylation</h2>
        <p>Here are the most common methods for decarboxylating cannabis:</p>
		
        <h3>1. Oven Method</h3>

        <div class="content-image-wrapper align-left">
                <a href="/images/decarb/decarb-oven-temp.jpg" data-caption="Set oven to 240°F (115°C)">
                    <img src="/images/decarb/th-decarb-oven-temp.jpg" alt="Oven set to the correct temperature for decarboxylation">

				</a>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Baking sheet, parchment paper, oven.</li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 240°F (115°C).</li>
                    <li>Finely grind your cannabis.</li>
                    <li>Spread the ground cannabis evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>The cannabis should turn golden brown when it's done.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <h3>2. Sous Vide Method</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Sous vide machine, vacuum sealer bags, water bath.</li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your sous vide water bath to 203°F (95°C).</li>
                    <li>Place your cannabis in a vacuum sealer bag and seal it tightly.</li>
                    <li>Submerge the bag in the water bath and cook for 90 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the bag.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Successful Decarboxylation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grind Consistency:</strong> Finely grind your cannabis for even heating and decarboxylation.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature Control:</strong> Use an oven thermometer, or two to ensure accurate temperature. Overheating can degrade THC.</li>
            <li><strong>Time:</strong> Don't rush the process. Proper decarboxylation takes time.</li>
            <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Your cannabis will have a toasted, nutty aroma when it's properly decarboxylated.</li>
            <li><strong>Important Note:</strong> Decarboxylation produces a strong odor. Ensure proper ventilation in your kitchen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By following these simple steps, you can decarboxylate your cannabis effectively and enjoy the full benefits of your homemade infusions.</p>
