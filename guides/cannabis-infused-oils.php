    <section class="page-content">
        <p>Once you've mastered <a href="/guides/decarb-cannabis.php">decarboxylation</a>, the next step is infusion. This process extracts the activated cannabinoids (like THC) from the plant material into a carrier substance. This guide will walk you through making versatile infusions using fats like oil and butter, as well as potent tinctures using alcohol.</p>

        <h2>The Science: How Infusion Works</h2>
        <p>Understanding why infusion works helps you make better products. It comes down to a simple principle: solubility.</p>
        
        <h3>THC and Fats (Lipophilicity)</h3>
        <p>Cannabinoids like THC are <strong>lipophilic</strong>, which is a scientific term for "fat-loving." Their molecular structure is non-polar, causing them to be naturally repelled by water (which is polar) but strongly attracted to fats and oils (which are also non-polar). When you gently heat cannabis in a fat, the activated THC molecules happily leave the plant material and dissolve into the surrounding fat molecules, creating a potent and stable infusion.<br><em>Source: Based on the chemical principle "like dissolves like." Non-polar cannabinoids dissolve in non-polar lipids (fats).</em></p>
        
        <h3>THC and Alcohol (Solvent Extraction)</h3>
        <p>High-proof alcohol acts as a powerful <strong>solvent</strong>. Instead of just attracting the THC, it actively strips the trichomes—the tiny, crystal-like glands on the cannabis flower that contain the vast majority of cannabinoids and terpenes—directly from the plant material. This is a very efficient and fast method, resulting in a potent liquid extract often used for tinctures or to create concentrates like FECO/RSO.</p>

        <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decarboxylated Cannabis:</strong> Amount depends on desired potency. Start small (e.g., 3-7 grams).</li>
            <li><strong>Carrier of Choice:</strong> See the list below (e.g., 1 cup of coconut oil, butter, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Gentle Heat Source:</strong> A double boiler is ideal. A slow cooker on low or a saucepan on the lowest setting also works.</li>
            <li><strong>Straining Material:</strong> Cheesecloth or a fine-mesh metal strainer.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Container:</strong> A clean, airtight glass jar is perfect.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine and Melt:</strong> Gently melt your chosen fat (oil/butter) in your double boiler or pot. Do not let it smoke.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Cannabis:</strong> Once melted, add your ground, decarbed cannabis. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li><strong>Infuse Low and Slow:</strong> Keep the mixture on very low heat for 2-4 hours. The liquid should never boil or simmer aggressively. Stir every 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Strain Carefully:</strong> Set your cheesecloth or strainer over your storage container. Slowly pour the hot mixture through it.</li>
            <li><strong>Squeeze (Optional but Recommended):</strong> Once cool enough to handle, gather the cheesecloth and gently squeeze out all the remaining oil from the plant material. This is where much of the potency is!</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Store:</strong> Let the infused product cool to room temperature, then seal and store in a cool, dark place. Refrigeration will extend its shelf life.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Choosing Your Carrier: Notes on Different Fats & Solvents</h2>
        <h3>Fat-Based Carriers (for Edibles & Topicals)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coconut Oil / MCT Oil:</strong> The gold standard. Its high saturated fat content makes it an excellent carrier for cannabinoids. Refined coconut oil has a neutral taste, while unrefined has a stronger coconut flavor. MCT oil remains liquid at room temperature, making it great for dropper bottles.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter (Clarified/Ghee):</strong> Perfect for baking. It's crucial to use <strong>clarified butter (ghee)</strong>. Regular butter contains water and milk solids which do not bind with THC and can cause your infusion to go rancid faster. To clarify, simply melt butter on low and skim off the white milk solids that rise to the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa Butter:</strong> The best choice for making homemade cannabis chocolates or suppositories. It's solid at room temperature and has a rich flavor that pairs well with cannabis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Alcohol & Glycerin Carriers (for Tinctures)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-Proof Alcohol (Everclear, Spirytus):</strong> For potent tinctures. Use food-grade, high-proof (190 proof / 95% ABV) alcohol. The process is much faster (a "quick wash" or QWET method can take minutes, not hours) but requires extreme caution. <strong>NEVER use an open flame or gas stove when working with high-proof alcohol.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Vegetable Glycerin (VG):</strong> A non-alcoholic, sweet-tasting alternative. VG is not as efficient at extraction as alcohol, resulting in a less potent tincture. Infusion time is similar to fats (several hours) and it's great for those avoiding alcohol.</li>
        </ul>
